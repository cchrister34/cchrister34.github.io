            <p class="description-text">
                This 3D graphics program was created using PSSL, Sony's shader language for the Playstation 4 console alongside C++ to create a scene 
                that showcases various graphical techniques and technologies commonly used in the games industry as a part of my 3D graphics programming module at Northumbria University. Features include, a variety of 3D models created by reading model data (position, colour, normals, UVs)
                from external files and loading them into the vertex and index buffers, A moving camera controlled by the PS4 contoller, translation, rotation and scaling of models using world matrices and applying them in the correct order, 
                texture mapping, generating smooth and flat normals, multiple pipelines to apply different shader properties to different objects based on their material, ADS lighting with multiple light sources including directional, point and spotlight 
                and a very basic HUD that displayes text or numbers on the screen that is unaffected by the lighting in the scene.
                <br>
                <br>
                Due to the protected nature of PSSL and the Playstation 4 development environment, I am unable to share code snippets or images that involve PSSL or the PS4 SDK. However, I can showcase some of the C++
                code I wrote for this project that demonstrates key concepts and techniques used in the program.

            <h2 class="description-title">What I learned</h2>
            <p class="description-text">
                Since this was my first experience working with graphics programming and shaders, I learned a lot about the underlying concepts and techniques used in 3D graphics.
                I gained an understaning of how 3D models are created using vertex and index data and the order in which this data is processed through the graphics pipeline by passing vertex, 
                index data stored in the CPU with the transformations to the GPU and how vertex and pixel shader process this data to render images on the screen and apply lighting.
                I also learned about various graphical techniques such as texture mapping using UV data, ADS lighting and normal generation. Most importantly, 
                I developed my problem-solving skills as this was my most challenging programming project to date, requiring me to improve my ability to locate and fix bugs, optimise code and manage memory effectively.
                My knowledge of C++ was also greatly improved as I utilised OOP principles such as utilising polymorphism to create an asset manager to retrieve models, pipelines, textures and materials.
            </p>
            <h2 class="description-title">Problems Faced</h2>
            <p class="description-text">
                The first hurdle I overcome was creating my first hard-coded 3D model by manually defining vertex and index data within the code, this led to me gaining an initial understanding of how the data that 
                reperesents a 3D model is structured and processed specifically, how the triangles are created using anticlockwise winding order in the index buffer. The main challenge I encountered during this project was 
                debugging shader code as to solve errors it required me to have a solid understanding of the graphics pipeline and how the vertex and index data is processed, which required me to do a lot of 
                trial and error to identify the root cause of the problem. Due to the protected nature of the API, I also faced challenges applying graphical concepts
                as there was limited documentation available, which required me to experiment and be independent in my learning to create solutions. 
            </p>
                <br><br>    
            <h2 class="description-title">Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="description-text">
                Overall, this project taught me a lot about graphics programming and the underlying concepts and techniques used in 3D graphics and improved my C++ and problem-solving skills significantly. 
                It was a challenging but rewarding experience that has sparked my interest in learning more about graphics programming how it is used in the games industry. I would like to personally thank
                Dan Hodgson of Northumbria University for providing detailed tutors and guidance throughout this project which greatly aided my learning experience.
