            <p class="description-text">
                Lights out is a survival horror game prototyped in Unreal Engine 5 during my third year at Northumbria University as part of a group project with the goal of creating an engaging experience.
                The game features a dark environment where the player must navigate through a series of rooms while avoiding a deadly enemy that hunts them down. The player has a flashlight to help them see in the dark, 
                but it has limited battery life, adding to the tension and challenge of the game. The objective is to collect a set number of generator parts to access the generator and complete a small puzzle to restore power
                and overcome the enemy.

            <h2 class="description-title">What I learned</h2>
            <p class="description-text">
                This project was my first experience working in a team to create a game, which taught me the importance of communication and collaboration in game development. I learned how to effectively share ideas, 
                delegate tasks, and work together to achieve a common goal. I took on a development role within the team, a few examples of my contributions include level design, flashlight mechanics, and collectable object implementation that utilised OOP principles to inherit
                functionality from a base class created by another developer. Lights out helped me develop new skills while refining old skills alongside developing a better understanding of the game development process.

            <h2 class="description-title">Problems Faced</h2>
            <p class="description-text">
                One of the key challenges we faced during this project was coordinating our efforts and ensuring that everyone was on the same page. As a team of six, with four developers,we had to balance different schedules and work styles, 
                which sometimes led to miscommunication and delays. To overcome this, we regularly communicated our progress on discord and at universtiy and attended regular meetings with our supervisor to discuss progress and address any issues that arose. We also utilised 
                version control software to manage our project and ensure that everyone had access to the latest changes and recover previous versions when needed, which helped us on several occasions when merge conflicts occurred and 
                classes were accidentally removed in a commit.
            </p>

            <h2 class="description-title">Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="description-text">
                Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience that helped me develop my skills in teamwork, communication, and game development. 
                I learned how to work effectively in a team, manage my time and resources, and create a fun and engaging game experience. I am proud of what we accomplished as a team and look forward to applying these skills to future projects.
