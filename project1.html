            <p class="description-text">
                Cosmos Conqueror was developed as part of my coursework for my games programming module during my second year at Northumbria University.
                It was my first game made in C++ inside a primitive engine built using the SDL2 library provided by the university. I was provided with a primitve 
                engine framework that handled basic rendering, input, and game loop functionality, and I was tasked with building a simple 2D space shooter game on top of it.

            <h2 class="description-title">What I learned</h2>
            <p class="description-text">
                This project was my first experience working with C++ in a game development context, and it provided me with a solid foundation through the use of object oriented programming principles.
                I learned how to create classes and objects, implement inheritance and polymorphism, and manage memory using pointers and dynamic allocation. 
            </p>
                <br><br>
            <h2 class = "description-title">Problems Faced</h2>
            <p class="description-text">
                One of the key challenges I faced during this project was coupling as before creating the project, I did not properly plan out how game objects would interact with each other,
                which led to tight coupling between classes. This made it diffiucult to make changes as my project progressed, the spaceship class quickly became monolithic with the amount 
                of logic implemented. To solve this, i would refacrtor the code to use interfaces and abstract classes to define common behaviours and interactions between game objects.
            </p>    
                <br><br>
            <h2 class = "description-title">Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="description-text">
                Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience that provided me with a solid foundation in C++ and object oriented programming principles. It also taught me the importance of 
                planning and designing my code before implementation to avoid tight coupling and ensure maintainability as the game grows in complexity. I am proud of what I accomplished with Cosmos Conqueror,
                and I look forward to applying the skills and knowledge I gained to future game development projects.
