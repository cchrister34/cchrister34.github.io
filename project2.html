            <p class="description-text">
                Bad Bot is my first project in Unreal Engine, created to help me learn the basics of blueprints and gain more experience in the engine.
                The game is a simple third-person shooter where I focused on building simple systems such as player movement using input mappings and input actions, 
                shooting using line traces and a crosshair, and very basic enemy AI that tracks the pawns' positon and shoots at them in addition to sound and niagra systems
                to enhance the overall experience.

                                    The enemy fire rifle logic is set up by storing the pawn object in a variable using a dynamic cast to access the pawn's location.
                                    Then by using a looping timer based on an event dispatcher that is triggered after a two second delay. In response to this event, 
                                    a fire blaster function is called that spawns blaster beams at the pawn's rifle sockets' location.

                                    The line trace logic is used to determine if blaster-beam projectiles hit an actor. This is then used to call a blueprint interface 
                                    function, set in the blaster-beam blueprint that applies damage to the hit actor. The respective actors implement this interface to handle taking damage based 
                                    on their own health variables.

            <h2 class="description-title">What I learned</h2>
            <p class="description-text">
                This project was my first experience working in Unreal Engine, and it provided me with a solid foundation in using blueprints to create game mechanics and systems. Bad Bot taught me 
                re-usable engine skills that I can apply to future projetcs, such as setting up input mappings and actions, creating line traces for shooting mechanics, sound and niagra systems, blueprint interfaces and 
                the importance of using functions in blueprints to avoid spaghetti code.
                <br><br>
                One of the struggles I faces during this project was learning how to implement the correct functions and nodes in blueprints to achieve the desired functionality, as the blueprint system exposed me to 
                a wide range of nodes and functions that I had to learn to use effectively. However, through trial and error, as well as consulting online resources and documentation, I was able to overcome these challenges and
                create a functional game.
                <br><br>
                Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience that helped me develop my skills in Unreal Engine and blueprints, and I look forward to applying these skills to future projects.
