            <p class="description-text">
                Bad Bot is my first project in Unreal Engine, created to help me learn the basics of blueprints and gain more experience in the engine.
                The game is a simple third-person shooter where I focused on building simple systems such as player movement using input mappings and input actions, 
                shooting using line traces and a crosshair. In addition, I learned how OOP principles can be applied within blueprints utilsing inheritance and polymorphism 
                to create modular objects that can be extended upon.

            <h2 class="description-title">What I learned</h2>
            <p class="description-text">
                This project was my first experience working in Unreal Engine, and it provided me with a solid foundation within the editor, learning how to create and move objects to create a small game using blueprints. Bad Bot taught me 
                re-usable engine skills that I can apply to future projects, such as setting up input mappings and actions, creating line traces for shooting mechanics, sound and niagra systems, blueprint interfaces and 
                the importance of using functions in blueprints to avoid spaghetti code.
                <br><br>

            <h2 class="description-title">Problems Faced</h2>
            <p class="description-text">
                One of the struggles I faced during this project was learning how to implement and maintain clean code within blueprints. Since blueprints are visual scripts, it can be easy to create a lot of dependencies between classes,
                leading to slower performance and difficulty in debugging. To overcome this, I consulted online resources and the Unreal Engine documentation to learn best practices for blueprint organisation and structure. This led to me creating blueprint
                interfaces to define common behaviours between different classes and using functions to encapsulate logic that can be reused across multiple blueprints.
            </p>
                <br><br>
            <h2 class="description-title">Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="description-text">
                Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience that helped me develop my skills in Unreal Engine and blueprints. I learned how to naviagte the engine more effectively and create basic game mechanics using visual scripting. 
                I am proud of what I accomplished with Bad Bot, and I look forward to applying these skills to future projects.
